This is a full course on JavaScript. 
In the JavaScript_Material folder, you will find files that consist of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
The files are broken up into lessons and small projects that build off of those lessons.
The YouTube video I followed closely was made by Bro Code. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfmg-EJ8gm4&t=29386s
This is all used for educational purposes. Feel free to use any of it.
